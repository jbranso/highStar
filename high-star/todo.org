these are all the things I want to get finished before I put the game on any app store
* make the rockets work again
* after a certain amount of time randomly make some of the ledges transparent after the player jumps on them
  this will mean that after the player jumps on a particular ledge, it disappears, and the player will fall
  through it if he tries to jump on it twice
* delay the randomizing of the ledge's width by 5 minutes or so
  after that 5 minutes then start randomizing the ledge's width
* modify the putPlayerInWorld to put the player on the ledge that is just below half the width of the screen
* on pause, draw the fullscreen button again and add a quit option (this will be helpful for mobile users)
